    articleTest: `ðŸ“– Reflections of a First-Year CS Student

- written by me, living inside this very retro-styled portfolio

There's something poetic about reading this article within the very portfolio that represents the end of a chapter. It's like watching the credits of a film you just starred in. And what a ride this first year of Computer Science has been.

I started like anyone else: uncertain, curious, and at times overwhelmed. The world of computing didn't come with a map - just passion and persistence. At first, it was all about writing basic programs, understanding logic, and memorizing rules. But over time, I realized CS is not about rules - it's about thinking.

What started with variables and System.out.println slowly evolved into solving real problems. I moved from theory to projects, from abstract terms to meaningful applications. I learned Java deeply, nailed OOP concepts, and got comfortable with writing code that not only works, but makes sense. I found excitement in writing React code, styling interfaces, and even creating sounds on toggle buttons. I started understanding how everything connects - from frontend logic to backend potential.

There were moments of frustration, of course. Like when I struggled to understand how async worked, or when I thought a project would take two hours but ended up consuming the entire weekend. But every one of those moments was a stepping stone. And I took each one, proudly.

I built projects that meant something to me - not because they were perfect, but because they were mine. I played with ideas, broke things, and fixed them. I asked questions - sometimes too many - and kept pushing to understand. It wasn't about showing off. It was about growing.

Looking forward, I know I'm still at the beginning of the journey. There's so much to learn - Express, backend frameworks, maybe even AI and chatbots. But for now, I know that I'm capable of learning anything I choose to. Because this first year? It proved it.

So here I am, wrapping up my first-year summer semester, staring into the next horizon with clarity and fire.

And to anyone reading this (especially me in the future): Remember how far you've come - and how much further you're going to go.`,

    articleTest: `Vibe Coding Is Ruining Us

Written by a first-year CS student who just kept pressing Enter one too many times.

I don't know when it started, but at some point, I realized I wasn't really coding. I was just... pressing keys. Opening up my IDE, playing music in the background, and writing whatever came to mind. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't - but I kept going anyway. It looked cool. It felt productive. But most of the time, I didn't even know what I was doing.

That's vibe coding. And it's a problem.

Vibe coding is when you're just "coding to code." You're not thinking much. You open a file, write something, maybe paste from Stack Overflow, maybe copy something from ChatGPT, and hope for the best. You tell yourself you're learning - and maybe you are, a little - but deep down, you're just clicking and scrolling and tabbing and pressing Enter like it'll figure itself out.

Thing is, as a first-year CS student, that's dangerous.

Because this is the year where I'm supposed to build my foundation. Learn the basics. Actually understand how stuff works. But if I keep coding like this, I'll hit a wall fast. Let's say I somehow land a job and now I'm stuck trying to reverse a linked list or center a div. What am I gonna do? Open VSCode and press Enter until the problem gives up?

It doesn't work like that.

I get that not everyone learns the same way. But vibe coding can trick you. It can make you feel like you're making progress when you're actually just moving in circles. We're not supposed to be code clickers. We're supposed to be problem-solvers. Builders. People who understand what's going on behind the screen.

The scary part is this: what if vibe coding becomes the norm? What if the industry gets filled with developers who don't really know how to code, just how to use tools? What if programming turns into clicking around templates and pasting code without ever stopping to ask, "Why does this even work?"

That's why I'm trying to stop. Slow down. Actually read the code. Break it. Fix it. Think before writing. Learn the real stuff - not just how to make things run, but how to make them right.

Because in the end, when the music stops, the only thing that'll matter is whether I actually learned something - or just vibed my way through another broken project`,
